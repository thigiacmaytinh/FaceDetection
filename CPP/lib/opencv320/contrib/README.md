An overview of the contrib modules and a small explanation
----------------------------------------------------------

This list gives an overview of all modules available inside the contrib repository.
These are also the correct names for disabling the building of a specific module by adding

```
$ cmake -D OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=<opencv_contrib>/modules -D BUILD_opencv_reponame=OFF <opencv_source_directory>
